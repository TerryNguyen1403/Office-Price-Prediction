## Office Price Prediction with Polynomial Regression

This project aims to implement a Polynomial Regression model to predict office prices based on 2 features. The dataset and problem inspiration are derived from HackerRank's Regression Challenges (here is a problem description link: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/predicting-office-space-price/problem).

My solution use Polynomial Regression to capture non-linear relationships between those 2 features. Then the model is trained on input data provided by HackerRank.
